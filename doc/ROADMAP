  To start with, I’m looking for a very simple framework that allows an 
  account creation, a document to be created, saved into the account, and then 
  exported in a choice of formats. Four screens to the app, then:

  1. Login screen
    – User account creation
  
  2. User document repository
    – List of all documents in their account – “Create a new document”

  3. Document creation screen
    – TEXTAREAS for
      – Title
      – Short summary
      – Teaser
      – Complete Copy
    - TEXTAREAS which will eventually be replaced with something else for
      – Locations
      – People
      – Companies
      – Keywords
    - Dropdown menus
      – Language written in
    - Save button
      - To be eventually made irrelevant with auto-saving
  
  4. Export story page
    - Page for each story to export story in:
      – Plain text
      – Word Doc
      – PDF

    Each of these pages will get more complicated as we go along, but I’d like 
    to get the Simplest Possible Thing up over the next few days, and then we 
    can move on with a shared language. Make sense?

    All of these pages should be unstyled HTML.
