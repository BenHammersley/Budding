  MySQL tables and resulting models
  ---------------------------------
  
  users:
    model: User()
    attributes:
      user_id, email{60}, password{60}
    methods:
      before_create() -- encrypts password with BCrypt
      login(email, password) -- returns boolean
      documents() -- list of documents associated to user
  
  documents:
    model: Document()    
    attributes:
      document_id, user_id, title, short_summary, teaser, story{65535},   
      locations, people, companies, keywords, language_id, created_on
    methods:
      before_create() -- assigns Time.now to created_on
      user() - user associated to document
      language() - language associated to document

  languages:
    mode: Language()
    attributes:
      language_id, name
      
  Document-orientation and Redis
  ------------------------------
  
  First, a quick reminder about Document::story and its 64kb limit due to
  MySQL's TEXT type. We may very well have to move to MEDIUMTEXT or BIGTEXT.
  
  By looking at the models above, it looks like something we could very easily
  accomplish with Redis. Over the next few days I'll sketch out a set of keys
  we could use to reproduce our current MySQL model in Redis. We should keep
  such sketch updated as we move towards a more mature, post-prototyping 
  model and be ready to make the switch somewhen in the future.
