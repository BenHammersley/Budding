The [[Apple II series|Apple II]] was introduced on April 16, 1977 at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. It differed from its major rivals, the [[TRS-80]] and [[Commodore PET]], because it came with color graphics and an open [[computer architecture|architecture]]. While early models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5&amp;nbsp;1/4&amp;nbsp;inch [[floppy disk]] drive and interface, the [[Disk II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Apple II History Chapter 4 | url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04.html | author=Steven Weyhrich| date=April 21, 2002 | accessdate=August 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 1970s, Apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line. The company introduced the ill-fated [[Apple III]] in May 1980 in an attempt to compete with [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]] in the business and corporate computing market.&lt;ref&gt;Coventry, Joshua.

Jobs and several Apple employees including [[Jef Raskin]] visited [[Xerox PARC]] in December 1979 to see the [[Xerox Alto]].

===1981–1985: Lisa and Macintosh===

Steve Jobs began working on the [[Apple Lisa]] in 1978 but in 1982 he was pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting, and took over Jef Raskin's low-cost-computer project, the Macintosh. A turf war broke out between Lisa's &quot;corporate shirts&quot; and Jobs' &quot;pirates&quot; over which product would ship first and save Apple. Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemlisa&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas.

[[File:Macintosh 128k transparency.png|thumb|The first [[Macintosh]], released in 1984.]]
In 1984, Apple next launched the Macintosh. Its debut was announced by the now famous $1.5 million [[1984 (television commercial)|television commercial &quot;1984&quot;]]. It was directed by [[Ridley Scott]], aired during the third quarter of [[Super Bowl XVIII]] on January 22, 1984,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duke.edu/~tlove/mac.htm Apple's 1984: The Introduction of the Macintosh in the Cultural History of Personal Computers]&lt;/ref&gt; and is now considered a watershed event for Apple's success&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/kevinmaney/2004-01-28-maney_x.htm Apple's '1984' Super Bowl commercial still stands as watershed event]&lt;/ref&gt; and a &quot;masterpiece&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;masterpiece&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url = http://edition.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/02/02/eye.ent.commercials/| title = Why 2006 isn't like '1984'| accessdate = May 10, 2008| last = Leopold| first = Todd| date = February 3, 2006| work = [[CNN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cellini&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb197/is_200401/ai_n5556112| title = The Story Behind Apple's '1984' TV commercial: Big Brother at 20| accessdate = May 9, 2008| last = Cellini| first = Adelia| month = January | year=2004| work = [[Macworld]] 21.1, page 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Macintosh initially sold well, but follow-up sales were not strong.&lt;ref name=&quot;lem1985&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas.

Retrieved on March 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This was because of the again high price tag, as well as limited software titles.  The machine's fortunes changed with the introduction of the [[LaserWriter]], the first [[PostScript]] [[laser printer]] to be offered at a reasonable price point, and [[PageMaker]], an early [[desktop publishing]] package. The Mac was particularly powerful in this market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which were already necessarily built-in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI. It has been suggested that the combination of these three products was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/beginners/f/when_dtp.htm When was desktop publishing invented?] Retrieved on April 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's sustained growth during the early 1980s was in great part due to its leadership in the education sector, attributed to an implementation of the  [[Logo (programming language)|LOGO Programming Language]] by Logo Computer Systems Inc., (LCSI), for the Apple II platform. The success of Apple and  LOGO in the education environment provided Apple with a broad base of loyal users around the world. The drive into education was accentuated in California by a momentous agreement concluded between Steve Jobs and Jim Baroux of LCSI, agreeing with the donation of one Apple II and one Apple LOGO software package to each public school in the state.  The arrangement, eventually replicated in Texas, established a strong and pervasive presence for Apple in all schools throughout California, which ignited the acquisition of Apple IIs in schools across the country. The conquest of education became critical to Apple's acceptance in the home, as parents supported continued learning experience for children after school.

[[Image:Macintosh portable.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Macintosh Portable]] was Apple's first &quot;portable&quot; Macintosh computer, released in 1989.]]
Having learned several painful lessons after introducing the bulky [[Macintosh Portable]] in 1989, Apple introduced the [[PowerBook]] in 1991, which established the modern form and [[ergonomics|ergonomic]] layout of the laptop computer.&lt;ref name=&quot;lempb&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas.

Retrieved on March 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Macintosh Portable was designed to be just as powerful as a desktop Macintosh and turned out 17 pounds with a 12 hour battery life.  Apple sold fewer than 100,000 units.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  The Powerbook was 7 pounds and had a 3 hour battery life, and sold a billion dollars worth within the first year.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  The same year, Apple introduced [[System 7]], a major upgrade to the operating system, which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for [[Mac OS]] until 2001.

The success of the PowerBook and other products led to increasing revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemsculley&quot; /&gt; For some time, it appeared that Apple could do no wrong, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine ''[[MacLife|MacAddict]]'' has named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the &quot;first golden age&quot; of the Macintosh.

Following the success of the [[Macintosh LC]], Apple introduced the [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] line, a low end [[Macintosh Quadra|Quadra]] offering, and the ill-fated [[Performa]] line that was sold in several confusing configurations and software bundles to avoid competing with the various consumer outlets such as [[Sears]], [[Price Club]], and [[Wal-Mart]], the primary dealers for these models. The result was disastrous for Apple as consumers did not understand the difference between models.

During this time Apple experimented with a number of other failed consumer targeted products including [[QuickTake|digital cameras]], [[PowerCD|portable CD audio players]], [[PowerCD#AppleDesign Powered Speakers|speakers]], [[Bandai Pippin|video consoles]], and [[Apple Interactive Television Box|TV appliances]]. Enormous resources were also invested in the problem-plagued [[Newton (platform)|Newton division]] based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts. Ultimately, all of this proved too-little-too-late for Apple as their market share and stock prices continued to slide.

Apple saw the [[Apple II series]] as too expensive to produce, while taking away sales from the low end Macintosh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apple2history.org/history/ah11.html#11 Apple II History Chap 11]. Retrieved August 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Apple released the [[Macintosh LC]] with a single [[expansion slot]] for the [[Apple IIe Card]] to migrate Apple II users to the Macintosh platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apple2history.org/history/ah11.html#08 Apple II History Chap 11].

By the early 1990s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh, such as the [[A/UX]]. The Macintosh platform was becoming outdated since it was not built for multitasking, and several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware. In addition, Apple was facing competition from [[OS/2]] and [[UNIX]] vendors like [[Sun Microsystems]]. The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform, or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html 1990–1995: Hitting the Wall].

In 1994, Apple allied with IBM and [[Motorola]] in the [[AIM alliance]]. The goal was to create a new computing platform (the [[PowerPC Reference Platform]]), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple's software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind, thus countering Microsoft. The same year, Apple introduced the [[Power Macintosh]], the first of many Apple computers to use IBM's [[PowerPC]] processor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple-history.com/body.php?page=gallery&amp;model=6100&amp;performa=off&amp;sort=date&amp;order=ASC&amp;range= Power Macintosh 6100].

===Apple TV===
{{Main|Apple TV}}
At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the [[Apple TV]], (previously known as the iTV),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12itunes7.html Apple Announces iTunes 7 with Amazing New Features&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer's iTunes library and streams from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40&amp;nbsp;GB hard drive for storage, includes outputs for [[HDMI]] and [[component video]], and plays video at a maximum resolution of [[720p]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/01/09appletv.html Apple TV Coming to Your Living Room&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, 2007 a 160&amp;nbsp;GB drive was released alongside the existing 40&amp;nbsp;GB model&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/05/30appletv.html YouTube Coming to Apple TV&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and on January 15, 2008 a software update was released, which allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15appletv.html Apple Introduces New Apple TV Software &amp; Lowers Price to $229&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40GB Apple TV and now continues to produce and sell the 160GB Apple TV.

===Software===
{{See also|List of Macintosh software}}
Apple develops its own [[operating system]] to run on Macs, [[Mac OS X]], the latest version being [[Mac OS X v10.6|Mac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard]]. Apple also independently develops computer software titles for its Mac OS X operating system. Much of the software Apple develops is bundled with its computers. An example of this is the consumer-oriented iLife software package that bundles [[iDVD]], [[iMovie]], [[iPhoto]], iTunes, [[GarageBand]], and [[iWeb]]. For presentation, page layout and word processing, [[iWork]] is available, which includes [[Keynote (software)|Keynote]], [[Pages]], and [[Numbers (software)|Numbers]]. iTunes, [[QuickTime]] media player, [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser, and [[Software Update]] are available as free downloads for both Mac OS X and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

Apple also offers a range of professional software titles. Their range of server software includes the operating system [[Mac OS X Server]]; [[Apple Remote Desktop]], a remote systems management application; [[WebObjects]], [[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition|Java EE]] Web [[application server]]; and [[Xsan]], a [[Storage Area Network]] file system. For the professional creative market, there is [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] for professional [[Raw image format|RAW]]-format [[photo]] processing; [[Final Cut Studio]], a video production suite; [[Logic Pro|Logic]], a comprehensive music toolkit and [[Shake (software)|Shake]], an advanced effects composition program.

Apple also offers online services with [[MobileMe]] (formerly [[.Mac]]) that bundles personal [[web page]]s, [[email]], [[social network service|Groups]], [[iDisk]], [[Backup (backup software)|backup]], [[iSync]], and Learning Center online tutorials. MobileMe is a subscription-based internet suite that capitalizes on the ability to store personal data on an online server and thereby keep all web-connected devices in sync.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.apple.com/mobileme/features/|title=Apple.com&amp;nbsp;— MobileMe&amp;nbsp;— Features|accessdate=August 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Announced at MacWorld Expo 2009, [[iWork.com]] allows iWork users to upload documents for sharing and collaboration.

==Culture==
===Corporate===
Apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of what a [[corporate culture]] should look like in organizational hierarchy (flat versus tall, casual versus formal attire, etc.). Other highly successful firms with similar cultural aspects from the same period include [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Microsoft]]. Originally, the company stood in opposition to staid competitors like [[IBM]] by default, thanks to the influence of its founders; Steve Jobs often walked around the office [[barefoot]] even after Apple was a [[Fortune 500]] company. By the time of the [[1984 (television commercial)|&quot;1984&quot; TV ad]], this trait had become a key way the company attempts to differentiate itself from its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;[[ValueWiki:AAPL#Corporate Culture|Apple Corporate Culture]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the company has grown and been led by a series of chief executives, each with his own idea of what Apple should be, some of its original character has arguably been lost, but Apple still has a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably draws talented people into its employ, especially after Jobs' return. To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program. Apple Fellows are those who have made extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to [[personal computing]] while at the company. The Apple Fellowship has so far been awarded to a few individuals including [[Bill Atkinson]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzfeld&quot;&gt;[[Andy Hertzfeld|Hertzfeld, Andy]].

===Users===
According to surveys by [[J. D. Power]], Apple has the highest brand and repurchase loyalty of any computer manufacturer. While this brand loyalty is considered unusual for any product, Apple appears not to have gone out of its way to create it. At one time, [[Apple evangelist]]s were actively engaged by the company, but this was after the phenomenon was already firmly established. Apple evangelist [[Guy Kawasaki]] has called the brand fanaticism &quot;something that was stumbled upon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Huba, Jackie; McConnell, Ben. [http://www.creatingcustomerevangelists.com/resources/evangelists/guy_kawasaki.asp The father of evangelism marketing].&lt;/ref&gt; Apple has, however, supported the continuing existence of a network of [[Macintosh User Group|Mac User Groups]] in most major and many minor centers of population where Mac computers are available.

Mac users would meet at the European [[Apple Expo]] and the San Francisco [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo]] trade shows where Apple traditionally introduced new products each year to the industry and public until Apple pulled out of both events. While the conferences continue, Apple does not have official representation there. Mac developers, in turn, continue gather at the annual Apple [[Worldwide Developers Conference]].

[[Apple Store]] openings can draw crowds of thousands, with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening or flying in from other countries for the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2003/12/61513 Apple Store: Chain of Devotion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The New York City [[Fifth Avenue]] &quot;Cube&quot; store had a line as long as half a mile; a few Mac fans took the opportunity of the setting to propose marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifostore.cachefly.net/fifth_avenue/index.html ifo Apple Store – Fifth Avenue Grand Opening&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ginza]] opening in Tokyo was estimated in the thousands with a line exceeding eight city blocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japanconsuming.com/news/040828.html JapanConsuming.com: Apple in Osaka&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

John Sculley told ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper in 1997: &quot;People talk about technology, but Apple was a marketing company. It was the marketing company of the decade.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2002/12/56677 Wired News: Apple: It's All About the Brand]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple has since adopted [[USB]], [[AGP]], [[HyperTransport]], [[Wi-Fi]], and other industry standards in its computers and was in some cases a leader in the adoption of standards such as USB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-spec7.html Standards and specs: The ins and outs of USB&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[FireWire]] is an Apple-originated standard that has seen widespread industry adoption after it was standardized as [[IEEE 1394]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1394ta.org/Technology/index.htm 1394 Trade Association: What is 1394?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's first logo, designed by Jobs and Wayne, depicts [[Sir Isaac Newton]] sitting under an apple tree. Almost immediately, though, this was replaced by [[Rob Janoff]]'s &quot;rainbow Apple&quot;, the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the &quot;bitten&quot; logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. While Jobs liked the logo, he insisted it be in color to humanize the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2003/09/60597 Wired News: Apple Doin' the Logo-Motion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zlok.net/blog/2009/03/29/i-invented-the-apple-logo/ ZLOK Logo Design Blog: I Invented ... the Apple Logo]&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple logo was designed with a bite so that it would be recognized as an apple rather than a cherry. The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the monitor could reproduce images in color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativebits.org/interview/interview_rob_janoff_designer_apple_logo|title= Interview with Rob Janoff, designer of the Apple logo|first=Ivan|last=Raszl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, with the roll-out of the new iMac, Apple discontinued the rainbow theme and began to use monochromatic themes, nearly identical in shape to its previous rainbow incarnation.

==Environmental record==
[[Greenpeace]], an environmentalist organization, has confronted Apple on various environmental issues, including promoting a global end-of-life take-back plan, non-recyclable hardware components, and toxins within the [[iPhone]] hardware.&lt;ref name=itox /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.abcnews.com/Technology/PCWorld/story?id=3731164 ABC News: Is the iPhone Toxic? Greenpeace Says So]. [[ABC News]]. Retrieved August 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003 they have campaigned against Apple regarding their chemical policies, in particular the inclusion of [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] and [[brominated flame retardant|BFRs]] in their products, both of which have serious negative health effects.&lt;ref name=itox&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/apple/itox.html iTox + iWaste].

At the 2007 [[Macworld Expo]], Greenpeace presented a critique of Apple. Rick Hind, the legislative director of Greenpeace's toxics campaign, said, &quot;(The company) is getting greener, but not green enough.&quot; Hind commented further, &quot;The Macbook Air has less toxic PVC plastic and less toxic BFRs, but it could have zero and that would make Apple an eco-leader.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hylwpa&quot;&gt;[http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2008/01/green_apple Apple's 'Green' Notebook Doesn't Impress Environmentalists].

In May 2008, [[Climate Counts]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple 11 points out of a possible 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies. Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a &quot;stuck icon,&quot; and the environmental group added that Apple was &quot;a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/mac/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207601672 Environmental Group Hits Apple]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labor practices==
In 2006, the ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' alleged that [[sweatshop]] conditions existed in factories in China, where the contract manufacturers, [[Foxconn]] and [[Inventec]], operate the factories that produce the iPod.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-401234/The-stark-reality-iPods-Chinese-factories.html The Start Reality of iPod's Chinese Factories]&lt;/ref&gt;

The article stated that one iPod factory, for instance, had over 200,000 workers that lived and worked in the factory, with workers regularly doing more than 60 hours of labor per week. The article also reported that workers made around $100 per month were required to live on the premises and pay for rent and food from the company. Living expenses (required to keep the job) generally took up a little over half of the worker's earnings. The article also said that workers were given buckets to wash their clothes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/15/AR2006061501898.html Sweatshop Conditions at IPod Factory Reported]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2006/06/71138 Judging Apple Sweatshop Charge]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB118677584137994489.html?mod=blog The Forbidden City of Terry Gou]&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the allegations, Apple launched an investigation and worked with their [[manufacture]]rs to ensure that conditions were acceptable to Apple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macnewsworld.com/story/61454.html Apple, IT and the Specter of Sweatshop Labor]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Apple started yearly auditings of all its suppliers regarding Worker's Rights, slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply. Yearly progress reports have been published since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://images.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/pdf/L418102A_SR_2010Report_FF.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 and 2010, [[Foxconn]] factories supplying iPhones, iPads and other devices have still come under fire in the press, with one source describing conditions as a &quot;white collar prison&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-like-to-work-if-chinas-gadget-sweatshops-where-your-iphones-and-ipads-are-made-2010-4?utm_source=Daily+Buzz&amp;utm_campaign=81432d578c-nl_emv_db_04082010_a&amp;utm_medium=email |title=What It's Like To Work In China's Gadget Sweatshops Where Your iPhones And iPads Are Made |last=Carlson |first=Nicholas |date=April 7, 2010 |work=[[Business Insider]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the summer of 2009, one worker committed suicide by leaping off the factory building after misplacing an iPod prototype, and subsequent allegations that factory security &quot;roughed up&quot; the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/life-inside-a-chinese-gadget-factory-2009-7 |title=Life Inside A Chinese Gadget Factory |last=Carlson |first=Nichoas |date=July 27, 2009 |work=[[Business Insider]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in April 2010, four workers attempted suicide in a single month in the same factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-another-apple-supplier-factory-worker-tries-to-kill-herself-thats-4-in-4-weeks-2010-4 |title=Apple-Supplier Factory Worker Tries To Kill Herself -- That's 4 In 4 Weeks |last=Blodget |first=Harry |date=April 7, 2010 |work=[[Business Insider]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
